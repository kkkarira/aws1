AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
This repository contains a simple resume website built as part of the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge.
The resume is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.
The project leverages several AWS services to demonstrate practical skills in cloud computing.
